3Viludem Launch Game is a test drive with the purpose of testing mechanics that will be used in later serious game titles.
It was also created to test skills as a programmer and future video game development.
This game now complete, it will be used as a study guide or practice test for the next game which will be in a more 90s era type of complexity
as opposed to the 70s era complexitiy of this game. Many of this game's mechanics will be reused or revisioned to meet the criteria of the next game.
Hope you enjoy this little game as it will be the first of many to come.</h4>
